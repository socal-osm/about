  "body": "### Welcome to our page\r\nWe're just getting started to organize during and after the Great Los Angeles County Building import. That project is ongoing and you can jump in by following [the instructions](https://github.com/osmlab/labuildings/blob/master/IMPORTING.md) and [picking a task](http://labuildingsimport.com) to complete. The chatroom for that project is [hosted on Gitter](https://gitter.im/osmlab/labuildings). We're hosting events sporadically with MaptimeLA. Check their [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/maptimela/) for upcoming events. \r\n\r\n### Our goals\r\nWe want to improve the map in Southern California. Whether that means adding bus stops, fixing roads or drawing in swimming pools, that's the plan. You can jump in with any of our projects or suggest your own.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\nWe're looking for projects to connect the local OSM community after the building import. If you have an idea, request to be in the organization and then create a repository to sketch out that idea. We can then decide to tackle it and leverage the skills of several users to make it happen.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact @schleuss or any of the [members in our organization](https://github.com/orgs/socal-osm/people).",
